This project dedicated to studying the signals (reflectogramms) of Distributed Fiber Temperature Sensor based on Raman scattering (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_temperature_sensing).

This code implements the next:
1) Read the number of the files with reflectogramms
2) Substract the zero level (the average of 60 points) of Astokes and Stokes reflectogramms for each file  and take into only the measuring line (from 800 m to 8000 m):

I wrote the code that allows to estimate the deviation between the theoretical predictable and the experimental reflectograms. Then, I added the opportunity to convert reflectogramms to the thermogramms (Distribution of the Temperature on the measuring line).
