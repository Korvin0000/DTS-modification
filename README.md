This project dedicated to studying the signals (reflectogramms) of Distributed Fiber Temperature Sensor based on Raman scattering (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_temperature_sensing).

This code allows:
1) 
I wrote the code that allows to estimate the deviation between the theoretical predictable and the experimental reflectograms. Then, I added the opportunity to convert reflectogramms to the thermogramms (Distribution of the Temperature on the measuring line).
